# Benchmarking and Analysis of Network Functions

This project is a part of Master's curriculum. More details about the project can be found [here](https://en.cs.uni-paderborn.de/cn/teaching/theses-student-projects/student-project-groups-completed/ba). I was a part of benchmarking and analysis team where I was more inclined towards analysis of the data. 

### Key outcomes

<ol>
<li> Created docker images for network services such as Load balancers, proxy servers </li>
<li> Benchmarked the network services under various scenarios using a benchmarking tool called Tango-bench </li>
<li> Collected datasets which are then used for extensive exploratory data analysis </li>
<li> Analysed trends and patterns against different network services of same category for e.g. how do different load balancers such as NGINX, HAproxy, Traefik compare against        each other in terms of response time, handling requests per second etc.? </li>
<li> Extended the analysis to perform predictive analytics using Linear regression, random forest, SVM </li>
</ol>
